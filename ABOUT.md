# Virtualjog - WordPress Integration
This plugin is made to help insert Virtualjog's legal documents and features into WordPress.

## What is Virtualjog?
Virtualjog is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that provides legal documents and services
(such as Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Module) to thousands of clients.

## Do I need a paid subscription to use this plugin?
Yes you do.

## Is this a trialware?
No, it isn't. This is an integration for an already existing SaaS. That said, you do need a Virtualjog account to use this plugin.

## The plugin is asking for an access token. What is that?
The plugin is intended for our customers who already have a subscription with us.
The access token ensures the plugin embeds the correct documents into your website.

## What does this plugin provide?
It provides seamless document integration between our software and your website. With just a few clicks, you can embed your legal documents into your site.

It also contains a back-end solution for our cookie module. Most cookie modules on the market only offer a JavaScript runtime-based solution, which can be bypassed by tracking software. You want to ensure that you won't track your site visitors without their explicit permission.
This plugin intercepts your tracking integrations first, so you don't accidentally violate European data protection laws.

## Features
- Insert legal document to your site with just a few clicks ( Terms of Service, Privacy Policy)
- Insert a Cookie Module to your site that handles GDPR.
